i did option 1
assistant: Got it — you're now on the latest from GitHub.

Want me to check what's in the current repo, or do you need help with something else?

I was able to run it, but when I opened it in browser I just got a black page
assistant: **Checking for missing files...**

assistant: The code looks fine. The black screen is likely a build issue. Try:

```bash
cd /home/erik/.openclaw/workspace/levelforge-ui

# Full reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

If that still shows a black page, open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab and tell me what error shows up. That will tell us exactly what's failing.

To send an image back, prefer the message tool (media/path/filePath). If you must inline, use MEDIA:https://example.com/image.jpg (spaces ok, quote if needed) or a safe relative path like MEDIA:./image.jpg. Avoid absolute paths (MEDIA:/...) and ~ paths — they are blocked for security. Keep caption in the text body.
